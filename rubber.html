			<span><p>"Rubber farming is primarily done in the hilly regions of Kerala due to the favorable climate and soil conditions. Farmers plant rubber trees in smallholdings and maintain them for around 7 years before tapping the trees to collect the latex. The trees can be tapped for latex for around 25-30 years."</p></span>
